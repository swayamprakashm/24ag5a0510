**DevOps** is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that aim to bridge the gap between **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)**. The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, deliver high-quality software quickly, and improve collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
